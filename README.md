# PERN Application

Simple PERN todo application using React, TailwindCSS, NodeJs and PostgreSQL.

# How to run

- Run npm i in both the root folder and the client folder.
- CD into client folder and run npm run build
- You will need your own instalation of PostgreSQL inside your local machine. You can configure your connection in the db.js file on the root of the project, also make sure to change any of the existing queries to fit your table and database naming schemes.
- To run the NodeJs server, run npm run dev, application will be served on default route
- Alternatively, if you would like to just run a dev server for the frontend app, cd into the client folder and run npm run start
